  <h1>Building the Structure.</h1>
  </div>
  
    <div class="col-md-8">
  <p>In our implementation of the Atomic Design methodology, we meticulously categorized all the components used across our digital platforms into a structured hierarchy of atoms, molecules, and organisms.</p>

   <p> Our journey began with atoms, the foundational building blocks of our design system. Here, we focused on three critical elements: typography, color palettes, and spacing guidelines. These atomic elements served as the fundamental basis for our entire design ecosystem, ensuring consistency, coherence, and scalability across our digital presence.</p>
